  <h1>My Apology Letter</h1>
  <div class="letter">
    <p>My love, I just want you to know how sorry I am. I was dumb and did not think of it very carefully. That was very stupid of me and I should've thought more of it carefully.</p>
    <p>I hope by this letter, I can reach you properly. I hope you can know how much I treasure you and your peace. I didn't mean to break your trust and make you sad. It hurts me that I have made you into this state.</p>
    <p>Babie, I'm willing to do whatever I can to make you happy. I'll do an interpretative dance, I'll make a song, or I'll make a poem. I'll dedicate all of them to you, in hopes that I can cheer you up and restore some of your faith in me. I am willing to do everything that I can just to make you happy in my arms once again.</p>
    <p>Let me protect your peace once again my love. Please give me a final chance to do things right. I'll promise that I'll be better, be sweeter, be more posty posty, and be much more loving that I ever was. I love you, my baby.</p>
